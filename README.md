# Project1 - Deep Learning Project

This repository contains code and content for Assignment1 in the field of deep learning.

## Overview
The assignment involves implementing a linear regression model from scratch using PyTorch. The Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository demonstrates the implementation and training process.

## Contents
- [Notebook](Assignment1.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and training code.
- [Sample Data](data/): Sample synthetic regression data used for training.

## Prerequisites
- Python [version]
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Assignment1.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to understand the linear regression implementation.

## Usage
- The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on implementing a linear regression model from scratch using PyTorch.
- Run each cell in the notebook to see the implementation in action.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and data to gain a better understanding.

## Results
- The notebook provides insights into how a linear regression model is implemented and trained.
- You'll learn about defining models, loss functions, optimization, and training loops.

## Acknowledgments
- The code and content in this repository are based on course materials and resources from [source name or link].
